# Smart-Study-Partner
The Smart Study Partner app helps students find suitable study partners using artificial intelligence to match their interests and subjects, making learning more interactive and enjoyable. 
My project is called Smart Study Partner, an app designed to help students find suitable study partners easily and intelligently.
I created this application using the Mocha platform, which allows building interactive, AI-powered apps.
The app analyzes user data such as name, age, grade, and favorite subjects.
It then uses Machine Learning algorithms to match students with similar study interests.
I used tools like Text Input, Buttons, and AI Response Block to design the smart and simple interface.
This project encourages collaboration among students and makes studying more fun and engaging with a soft pink and white theme. 💗🤍
